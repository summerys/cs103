=============================== Prelab ==================================

1.
: make a seperate same size of 2D pointer array that keeps on track
  if each arraies of maze array was visited or not.  
  Update the 2D visited pointer array value from 0 to 1 
  everytime the value of maze array adds to the queue. 

2
: as soon as data is entered to the Queue contents, visited cell need to 
  be updated. 

=============================== Review ==================================

: it is 14X5 maze that is intented to
 have at least four different possible distance of pathways from start
 to finish : 11, 13, 15, 17
 When I ran the program, it behanved as expected. 

============================== Remarks ==================================

:more than 10 hours including office hours, discussions. 

:while loop to trace back and put '*' to maze array did not work well
 and took some time to figure it out.
